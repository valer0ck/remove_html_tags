# remove_html_tags

App builded with Django 1.8

It show how to use a filter to remove html tags and its content. Template folder has the file tested. I also include striptags filter, it remove all html tags but not content. I did it because i needed to remove heading tags from textfield and its content and print the page well.

Be careful using custom filters, they must remove html tags embed into others html tags.
